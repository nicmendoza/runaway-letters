		<p>Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? Your shields were failing, sir. The unexpected is our normal routine. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. Computer, belay that order. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. They were just sucked into space. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Shields up! Rrrrred alert! But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? I am your worst nightmare! Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapes? Are you up for promotion? Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. Damage report! Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. Ensign Babyface! Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. This should be interesting. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Besides, you look good in a dress. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. A surprise party?
